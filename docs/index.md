# Sign Language Tools ðŸ‘‹

This repository provides several tools facilitating the manipulation of sign language datasets. It was first developped by the authors of the [LSFB dataset](https://lsfb.info.unamur.be/) and then extended to other dataset using videos, gloss annotation and mediapipe landmarks to ease the setup of our ML pipeline.

This project is divided in two modules:

- [**visualization**](visualization.md) : This module provide an interface to visualize sign language datasets along with their annotations and pose landmarks.
- [**pose**](pose.md) : This module contains functions and datatypes helping to manipulate poses generated by [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) or [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose). You'll also find transform functions for pre-processing pose landmarks or add data-augmentation to your pipeline.

This module is used by researcher of the University of Namur and made public under the MIT license. Feel free to contribute.
