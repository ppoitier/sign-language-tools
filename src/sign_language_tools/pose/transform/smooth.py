    Smooth the landmarks by applying a Savitchy-Golay filter. If the window of the filter
    is bigger then the sequence, the sequence is returned unchanged.

    Args:
        window_length: Length of the filter window for Savitchy-Golay.Âµ
        polynom_order: Order of the polynom used by Savitchy-Golay.

    Returns:
        interpolated_landmarks: Tensor containing observed and interpolated landmarks.
